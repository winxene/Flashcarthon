### Definition:
Flashcarthon is a flashcard app designed to help people learn and remember Indonesian provinces and their capitals. This app aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool that makes the learning process more interactive and enjoyable, all woven in SwiftUI.

One of Flashcarthon's main features is the use of random flash cards. This feature allows users to test their knowledge of Indonesian provinces and capitals in a fun and challenging way. With each new set of flashcards, users are presented with a randomly selected state and its capital, allowing them to constantly test and improve their knowledge. In addition to random flashcards, Flashcarthon also offers learning cards. It provides information such as the map of the province, name of province, and capital city. In addition to that, users can sort the flash cards based on the islands in Indonesia to make the learning process easier by categorising it into an easy to understand pattern. This ensures that users can have fun and comfortable using Flashcarthon to memorise it at their own pace.

Moreover, using Flashcarthon to learn about Indonesian provinces and their capitals may trigger people's curiosity to explore more of Indonesia, thus Flashcarthon may serve as a gateway to not only learning about Indonesian geography but also promoting tourism in Indonesia.

This photo is intended to be used for displaying Indonesia's Provinces and its Capital Cities. I use this picture because it's the most updated version of Indonesia's map which features 38 Provinces based on the latest news. In addition to that, this picture is in SVG format, which is flexible to modify according to each part of the provinces in Indonesia.

 **Here are the news links which announces the declaration of 38th province in Indonesia**:
